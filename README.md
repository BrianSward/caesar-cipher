## How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)
so again i can't run python in my terminal because my setup is so trashed, i feel like this question is unfair
but something like...
`python3.11 cipher.py`

this file will translate "vw am boas wg, pfwob" -> "hi my name is, brian"
you can also test that it works using pytest but yah, no can terminal python

Tests
How do you run tests?
`pytest tests/test_caesar.py`

Any tests of note?
Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc
Crushed these tests, I enjoyed this one.
